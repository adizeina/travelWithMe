# travelWithMe

I made a travel blog website, inspo taken from a Wix template(I'm the best at designing from scratch , but I made it my own by using my own fonts, backgrounds and pictures used from my travels. 

Left to do:  
-Finish Canada collage page
-Figure out PHP for contact form

Extra features:
-Adding animations to main headers 
-Adding animations to background images (stretch out as you scroll)
-Adding animations to make collage for Cuba, Mexico, to unfold as you scroll.
